# UNIX

This repository is a series of UNIX commands that you can add to path and use as alternative commands. 

If you type in UNIX commands when using Windows by mistake, no longer worry - this repo is for you. There are lots of UNIX commands that you can use to make Windows feel like Linux. I have not written any of the commands - I have just collated them so that you can run them. For a full list of commands, see [commands](#commands).

## Use

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/George-Ogden/UNIX.git
```
Then add the folder to the PATH environmental variable:
```
setx path "%path%;c:\wherever\you\cloned\it\commands"
```
or you can do it manually.

## Updates

Use `git pull` to check for updates
